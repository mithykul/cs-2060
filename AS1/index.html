      <p>An award-winning classically trained pianist, <strong>Poland Ball</strong> specializes in performing music by Polish composers such as Frédéric Chopin, Ignacy Jan Paderewski, Karol Szymanowski, Krzysztof Penderecki, and Maria Szymanowska. Having started piano in 2009, they are a fourth-year music student at the University of Prince Edward Island studying piano with Dr. Magdalena von Eccher. Poland's performances have been described as "poised, confident, engaging" (Marnie Van Weelden, piano professor at Wilfrid Laurier University) and having "tremendous energy" (James Kalyn, professor at Mount Allison University).</p>
      <p>Poland competed on national and local levels; they have won prizes such as the <strong>Special Chopin Award in the 2024 FCMF National Music Festival</strong>, <strong>first prize in the 2024 Dr. Frances Gray Performance Competition</strong>, and the <strong>2023 Senior Rosebowl in Queen's County Music Festival.</strong></p>
      <p>Poland is experienced with chamber/ensemble settings and regularly accompanies the choral ensemble Island Choral Society and singer James Raonhan. They have also collaborated with Luminos Ensemble. Poland will be performing in two upcoming recitals: one on 15th March 2025, shared with saxophonist Nathan Wright, featuring the most popular works by Chopin, and one in November 2025, themed around extra-musical associations.</p>
